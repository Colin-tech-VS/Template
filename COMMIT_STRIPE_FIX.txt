Improve Stripe propagation: fix regex validation and add price_id endpoint

AUDIT: Complete stripe propagation flow (Dashboard → Template → Vitrine)

FINDINGS:
- Architecture is CORRECT: Dashboard only propagates keys, not prices
- Template is source of truth for product prices
- Secret keys properly secured (never exposed via GET)
- Constant-time comparison prevents timing attacks

FIXES APPLIED:

1. Improve Stripe key validation (CRITICAL MINOR)
   - Old: regex r'^(sk|pk)_(test|live)_[A-Za-z0-9]+$'
   - New: regex r'^(sk|pk)_(test|live)_[A-Za-z0-9_-]+$'
   - Reason: Stripe keys can contain hyphens and underscores
   - Impact: Accept more valid Stripe key formats

2. Add optional endpoint for price_id propagation (ENHANCEMENT)
   - New: PUT /api/export/settings/stripe_price_id
   - New: GET /api/export/settings/stripe_price_id
   - Allows Dashboard to push price IDs (optional feature)
   - Follows same auth pattern as stripe_publishable_key
   - Useful for centralized Stripe products (subscriptions, bundles)

DOCUMENTATION:
- STRIPE_PROPAGATION_AUDIT.md: Complete audit report with architecture analysis
- 10 sections covering: flux, security, prices, problems, recommendations

SECURITY:
- HMAC constant-time comparison maintained
- X-API-Key authentication required for PUT endpoints
- Validation regex improved to accept valid Stripe formats
- Secret key still never exposed via GET

TESTING:
- Syntax validated with py_compile
- No breaking changes
- Backward compatible
